# ⚠️ This starter is not recommended ⚠️

**This starter is not recommended for new Vaadin Flow applications. Instead, visit [start.vaadin.com](https://start.vaadin.com/) to configure and download a Vaadin project that reflects the current best practices.**


# Running the Project in Development Mode

`mvn spring-boot:run` or just `mvn`

Wait for the application to start

Open http://localhost:8080/ to view the application.

Default credentials are admin@vaadin.com/admin for admin access and
barista@vaadin.com/barista for normal user access.

Note that when running in development mode, the application will not work in IE11.

# Running Integration Tests and Linter

Integration tests are implemented using TestBench. The tests take a couple of minutes to run and are therefore included in a separate profile. We recommend running tests with a production build to minimize the chance of development time toolchains affecting test stability. To run the tests, execute

`mvn verify -Pit,production`

and make sure you have a valid TestBench license installed.

Profile `it` adds the following parameter to run integration tests:
```sh
-Dcom.vaadin.testbench.Parameters.runLocally=chrome
```

if you would like to run a separate test make sure you have added these parameters to VM Options of JUnit run configuration

# Automatic Restart and Live Reload

1. Vaadin Dev Tools interacts `spring-boot-devtools` and is able to automatically reload the browser when code is changed.

2. Optionally you might want to avoid the data generator to be run on each single reload, therefore, make H2 database store entities in file-system instead of in memory by adding the following lines to the `src/main/resources/application.properties`
```properties
spring.datasource.url=jdbc:h2:file:~/bakery-test-data
spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto=update
```


# Running the Project in Production Mode

`mvn -Pproduction`

The default mode when the application is built or started is 'development'. The 'production' mode is turned on by enabling the `production` profile when building or starting the app.


# Deploy the application for Production

`mvn package -Pproduction`

Then run it with

`java -jar target/*.jar`


# Deploying the Project in Control Center

Bakery has a profile that allows the application being deployed with [Control Center](https://vaadin.com/docs/latest/control-center)

Compile, package, build the image and upload to docker hub.

```
mvn package -P production -P control-center
docker build -t your_docker_id/bakery:latest .
docker push your_docker_id/bakery:latest
```

Import it in Control Center selecting the `Identity manager` flag. Then create roles `admin`, `baker` and `barista` in Control Center and create the corresponding users to login into bakery application.



# Running in Eclipse or IntelliJ
As both IDEs support running Spring Boot applications you just have to import the project and select `com.vaadin.starter.bakery.Application` as main class if not done automatically. Using an IDE will also allow you to speed up development even more. Just check https://vaadin.com/blog/developing-without-server-restarts.

# Running Scalability Tests

*NOTE* SCALABILITY TESTS ARE BROKEN

The Bakery App Starter includes scalability tests. Once you have deployed a production build of Bakery you can run them to check how the app behaves under load. The scalability tests can be run completely on your local machine, but you might as well want to run locally only the test agents while the Bakery app under test is deployed to an environment that is close to your production.

In order to run the scalability tests locally:

1. Make sure you are using Java 8 (Gatling Maven plugin does not yet work with Java 9+)

1. Build and start Bakery in the production mode (e.g. ```mvn clean spring-boot:run -DskipTests -Pproduction```)

1. Open terminal in the project root

1. Start a test from the command line:

    ```sh
    mvn -Pscalability gatling:test
    ```

1. Test results are stored into target folder (e.g. to ```target/gatling/BaristaFlow-1487784042461/index.html```)

1. By default the scalability test starts 100 user sessions at a 100 ms interval for one repeat, all of which connect to a locally running Bakery app. These defaults can be overridden with the `gatling.sessionCount`, `gatling.sessionStartInterval` `gatling.sessionRepeats`, and `gatling.baseUrl` system properties. See an example execution for 300 users started within 50 s:

    ```sh
    mvn -Pscalability gatling:test -Dgatling.sessionCount=300 -Dgatling.sessionStartInterval=50
    ```

Note: If you run Bakery with an in-memory database (like H2, which is the default), it will logically use more memory than when using an external database (like PostgreSQL). It is recommend to run scalability tests for Bakery only after you have configured it to use an external database.
